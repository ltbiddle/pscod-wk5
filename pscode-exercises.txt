// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

(your pseudocode here)

print to screen "Enter number one"
num1 = input
print to screen "Enter number two"
num2 = input
num1 + num2 = sum
print to screen the value for sum



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

Print to screen "Enter a number to check if it is even or odd"
num1 = input
If (num1 % 2) == 0
print to screen "The number is even"

else
print to screen "The Number is odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five num
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

print to screen "Enter Number 1"
num1 = input
print to screen "Enter Number 2"
num2 = input
print to screen "Enter Number 3"
num3 = input
print to screen "Enter Number 4"
num4 = input
print to screen "Enter Number 5"
num5 = input
avg = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 / 5
list = (num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
list.sort()
print to screen "The average is "avg"
print to screen "The smallest number is list[0]"
print to screen "The largest number is list[5]"
